# Coverage Map

![Coverage Map](/img/features/coverage-map.png)

The coverage map gives you an overview of the coverage of your repositories. It's a great way to see how your coverage is distributed between files and directories.

You can click any folder to drill down into the coverage of that folder. To save your poor browser from having to render all the directories in a large repository, the maximum depth that displayed at any given time is 3.
